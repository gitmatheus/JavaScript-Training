I'm very interested in understanding vanilla JS, local storage, events, and tests with Jest

class created on console is actually is a FUNCTION internally. 

ES5 = var
ES6 = let 

Types
string, number, boolean, object, undefined, function 


How to know the ESS version? 

JQuery: 
  $(domnode) -> returns a reference to a wrapper that contains several methods

  var le = document.getElem... 
  $le = $(le) 
  $le.hide()
  $le.show()


ID requires a hash "#"
$ is the only function you need, just pass the parameter (node, function, object, etc)


------
NODE 

npm init -y
Creates a package.json with default values (-y)

npm install jest 

Modify the package.json file with the following:
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
    },

Run the test 
npm test
   No tests found, exiting with code 1
